InsideLink - If this flag is true, than there is an inner link for each coupon in the page you are looking at (just like groupon).
RelativeInnerLink: This will appear only if the InsideLink flag is true. Will give you the right pattern to catch the innerlink
TheInnerLink: This will appear only if the InsideLink flag is true. Tha last pattern gave you only the relative path so you need to append this (TheInnerLink) with the Link you got befor.
(if this part is not clear look at the Groupon file code in webmatrix and see the code that devide the links to send to the insert_coupon file).
